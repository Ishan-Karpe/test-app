# Product Context: Simple Svelte Todo App

## Problem Solved

Users often need a quick and simple way to jot down and track basic tasks or reminders without the overhead of complex project management tools. Existing solutions might be overkill or require accounts/internet connectivity.

## Proposed Solution

A lightweight, browser-based Single Page Application (SPA) built with Svelte. It will provide fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for todo items:

*   **Create:** Add new tasks.
*   **Read:** View the list of tasks.
*   **Update:** Mark tasks as completed/incomplete.
*   **Delete:** Remove tasks.

The application will store data directly in the browser's `localStorage` for persistence between sessions on the same browser.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Minimalist Interface:** Clean, uncluttered design focusing on the core task list.
*   **Intuitive Controls:** Obvious ways to add, complete, and delete tasks.
*   **Responsiveness:** While the initial focus is desktop functionality, the layout should adapt reasonably to different screen sizes.
*   **Local Persistence:** Users should find their tasks saved when they reopen the app in the same browser.
