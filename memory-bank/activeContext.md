# Active Context: Simple Svelte Todo App

## Current Focus

* Implementation complete - all core functionality is working
* Addressing testing compatibility issues with Svelte 5
* Considering potential enhancements for future iterations

## Recent Changes

* Initialized Vite/Svelte project
* Implemented all core components:
  * `App.svelte` - Main container with state management
  * `AddTodoForm.svelte` - Form for adding new todos
  * `TodoList.svelte` - Container for todo items
  * `TodoItem.svelte` - Individual todo item display
* Implemented all required functionality:
  * Adding todos
  * Viewing todos
  * Toggling todo completion status
  * Deleting todos
  * Persisting todos in localStorage
* Added basic styling for a clean user interface
* Set up Vitest testing framework and created component tests

## Next Steps (Planned)

1. Fix testing compatibility issues with Svelte 5
2. Consider implementing enhancements:
   * Todo filtering (All, Active, Completed)
   * Todo editing
   * Bulk actions (Clear completed, Mark all as complete)
   * Drag and drop reordering

## Active Decisions & Considerations

* **Testing:** Need to investigate alternative testing approaches for Svelte 5
* **Enhancements:** Prioritize which enhancements to implement next
* **User Experience:** Consider gathering feedback on the current implementation

## Important Patterns & Preferences

* Maintained clean component structure with single responsibilities
* Used unidirectional data flow (props down, events up)
* Leveraged Svelte's built-in reactivity for state management
* Kept all files under 500 lines as per `.clinerules`

## Learnings & Insights

* Svelte 5 has compatibility issues with current testing libraries
* The component-based architecture worked well for this application
* localStorage provides a simple but effective persistence solution for this scale
* Svelte's reactivity system makes state management straightforward
