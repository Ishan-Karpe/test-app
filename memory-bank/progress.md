# Progress: Simple Svelte Todo App

## Current Status

*   **Phase:** Implementation Complete
*   **Date:** 2025-04-27
*   **Summary:** All core functionality implemented. Todo app allows adding, viewing, toggling completion, and deleting todos. Data persists in localStorage. Basic styling applied. Testing framework set up.

## What Works

*   Project Setup (Vite/Svelte)                <!-- Project initialization and tool setup are complete -->
*   Memory Bank File Creation                  <!-- Documentation and context files have been created -->
*   `PLANNING.md` / `TASK.md` Creation         <!-- Planning and task tracking files are in place -->
*   `App.svelte` implementation                <!-- Main app component is implemented -->
*   `AddTodoForm.svelte` implementation        <!-- Component for adding todos is implemented -->
*   `TodoList.svelte` implementation           <!-- Component for listing todos is implemented -->
*   `TodoItem.svelte` implementation           <!-- Component for displaying a single todo is implemented -->
*   Add Todo Logic                             <!-- Logic for adding todos works -->
*   View Todos Logic                           <!-- Logic for displaying todos works -->
*   Toggle Completion Logic                    <!-- Logic for marking todos as complete/incomplete works -->
*   Delete Todo Logic                          <!-- Logic for deleting todos works -->
*   `localStorage` Integration                 <!-- Todos are persisted in browser localStorage -->
*   Basic CSS Styling                          <!-- Basic styling is applied to the app -->
*   Testing Setup (Vitest)                     <!-- Vitest is set up for testing -->
*   Unit Tests for Components                  <!-- Unit/component tests have been written -->

## What's Left to Build / Implement

*   Fix test compatibility issues with Svelte 5    <!-- Current tests have compatibility issues with Svelte 5 -->
*   Potential enhancements:                        <!-- List of possible future features -->
    *   Todo filtering (All, Active, Completed)
    *   Todo editing
    *   Bulk actions (Clear completed, Mark all as complete)
    *   Drag and drop reordering

## Known Issues / Blockers

*   Tests are failing due to compatibility issues between Svelte 5 and the testing library   <!-- Main blocker: test failures due to Svelte 5 -->
*   Need to investigate alternative testing approaches for Svelte 5                         <!-- Next step: find a solution for testing with Svelte 5 -->

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Implemented a clean component structure following the system patterns defined            <!-- Followed planned architecture and patterns -->
*   Used Svelte's built-in reactivity for state management                                 <!-- Leveraged Svelte's reactivity for state -->
*   Implemented localStorage persistence for data                                          <!-- Used localStorage for data persistence -->
*   Added comprehensive styling for a polished user experience                             <!-- Focused on user interface quality -->
*   Set up testing framework but encountered compatibility issues with Svelte 5            <!-- Testing is set up, but issues remain -->
